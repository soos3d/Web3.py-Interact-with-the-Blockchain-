My goal here is to give clear examples to help teach how to interact with the blockchain using python!

To install the web3.py library in your environment run this code:

``` sh
pip install web3
```

> **Note** that on Windows, you will need to install the [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) to make it work.

I will add new files regularly as they are ready.

List of explanation files:

connection.py --> In this file you will find the code to connect to a blockchain and retrieve some information.<br>
tokens.py --> In this file you will find the code to retrieve tokens info using the contract address and ABI.<br>
transactions.py --> In this file you will find the code so send transactions.<br>
swap.py --> In this file you will the code to place swap transactions on PancakeSwap!<br>
