# Web3.py-Interact-with-the-Blockchain-
Here you will find the code from my Skillshare class WEB3.py: Interact with the Blockchain 

My goal here is to give clear examples to help teach how to interact with the blockchain using python!

I will add new files regularly as they are ready.

List of explanation files:

connection.py --> In this file you will find the code to connect to a blockchain and retrieve some information.
tokens.py --> In this file you will find the code to retrieve tokens info using the contract address and ABI.
transactions.py --> In this file you will find the code so send transactions.
solidity_basics_loops.sol --> In this file you will find examples of loops and conditionals in solidity with some brief explanations as comments.
solidity_basics_enum.sol --> In this file you will find examples of enum in solidity with some brief explanations as comments.
